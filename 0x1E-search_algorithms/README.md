# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

A search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem.
Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

### Applications of search algorithms

* Retrieving a record from a database
* Finding the maximum or minimum value in a list or array
* Checking to see if a given value is present in a set of values etc
